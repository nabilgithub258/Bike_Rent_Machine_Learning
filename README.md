# Bike Rental Prediction Based on Linear Regression

## Overview

This project aims to predict bike rentals based on temperature using a linear regression model in R. The goal is to understand the relationship between temperature and bike rentals and create a model that can predict rental demand based on temperature data.

## Dataset

The dataset used contains historical records of bike rentals along with corresponding temperature values. Each record includes features such as date, temperature, and the number of bikes rented.

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning the dataset (handling missing values, outliers).
   - Feature engineering: extracting relevant features like day of the week, month, etc., from the date.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing the distribution of bike rentals and temperature.
   - Correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
   - Implementing a linear regression model (`lm` function in R) to predict bike rentals based on temperature.
   - Evaluating the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions.

## Usage

1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Ensure R is installed (preferably RStudio for ease of use).
   - Install required packages using `install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "caret", ...))`.
   - Please refer to the pdf to know exactly how we do it step by step.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the application of linear regression in R for predicting bike rentals based on temperature. It provides a foundation for further enhancements such as adding more features (e.g., weather conditions, holidays) or experimenting with different regression techniques.

## Update

I have updated the model to make it predict the count based on all the circumstances and equation in the data set, so now it can predict the count not only based on temperature but the entire the row.
